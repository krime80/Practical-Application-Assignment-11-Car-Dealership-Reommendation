  - Split the data: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets to train and evaluate models.

3. Modeling:
  - Select appropriate regression models: I choose regression model.
  - Train the models: Fit the selected models on the training data.
  - Evaluate model performance: Assess the performance of the models using evaluation metrics such as mean squared error, R-squared, etc.

4. Evaluation:
  - Interpret model results: Understand the coefficients/parameters of the model to determine which factors have the most significant impact on car prices.

5. Recommendations:
  - Based on the analysis, provide clear recommendations to the used car dealership on what consumers value in a used car.
  - Highlight factors that have the most significant influence on car prices.
  - Suggest strategies for the dealership to improve sales based on consumer preferences identified in the analysis.

**Model Evaluation: Training and Test RMSE Comparison**

**Training RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error):** The training RMSE value of 7052.24 indicates the average difference between the actual and predicted values of the target variable (price) in the training dataset. It measures the goodness of fit of the model to the training data, with lower values indicating better performance. In this case, the model's predictions on the training data have an average error of approximately 7052.24.

**Test RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error):** The test RMSE value of 8058.37 indicates the average difference between the actual and predicted values of the target variable in the test dataset. It measures how well the model generalizes to new, unseen data. A higher test RMSE compared to the training RMSE suggests that the model may be overfitting to the training data or that there are differences between the training and test datasets.

Overall, the model seems to perform reasonably well on the training data, as indicated by the relatively low training RMSE. 

**Factors Influencing Vehicle Price: Insights from Aggregated Coefficients Analysis**
The aggregated coefficients by price provide insights into how different features contribute to the predicted price in a linear regression model. Here's an analysis based on the coefficients:

1. **Condition**: The coefficient for condition is negative, indicating that as the condition of the vehicle deteriorates, the price tends to decrease. This is expected as better-conditioned vehicles typically command higher prices.

2. **Cylinders**: A negative coefficient suggests that as the number of cylinders in a vehicle increases, the price tends to decrease. This could be due to factors such as fuel efficiency or market demand.

3. **Drive**: A negative coefficient implies that certain drive types may be associated with lower prices compared to others. This could be influenced by factors such as vehicle performance or popularity among buyers.

4. **Fuel**: The negative coefficient suggests that certain types of fuel may be associated with lower prices. This could reflect preferences for more fuel-efficient vehicles or market trends favoring alternative fuel types.

5. **Manufacturer**: The positive coefficient indicates that certain manufacturers may produce vehicles with higher prices on average. This could be due to brand reputation, quality, or other factors influencing buyer perceptions.

6. **Model**: The coefficient close to zero suggests that the specific model of the vehicle may have minimal impact on its price in this analysis.

7. **Odometer**: The large negative coefficient suggests that higher mileage (as indicated by odometer readings) is strongly associated with lower prices. This aligns with common market perceptions where lower mileage is often equated with better value.

8. **Paint Color**: The negative coefficient suggests that certain paint colors may be associated with lower prices compared to others. This could be due to factors such as market demand or aesthetic preferences.

9. **Title**: The negative coefficient indicates that certain title statuses may be associated with lower prices. This could be related to factors such as vehicle history or legal status.

10. **Transmission**: The negative coefficient suggests that certain transmission types may be associated with lower prices. This could be influenced by factors such as performance, maintenance costs, or market demand.

11. **Type**: The negative coefficient indicates that certain vehicle types may be associated with lower prices. This could be due to factors such as size, functionality, or market demand.

12. **Year**: The positive coefficient indicates that newer vehicles tend to have higher prices, which is expected as newer models often come with updated features and technology.
